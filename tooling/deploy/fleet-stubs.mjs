// Placeholders for the fleet's service-binding targets (zero-dependency).
//
// Cloudflare refuses a deploy whose service binding names a Worker that does
// not exist yet (code 10143), and the fleet's bindings form cycles (billing
// <-> membership; membership -> notifications -> events -> membership), so on
// a fresh account no order of first deploys works. 04-workers used to break
// this by deploying the fleet once with the feedback edges stripped from the
// wrangler config (`cycle-break.mjs --strip`) and again, as a second landing
// and a second convergence, with them restored.
//
// This does it with ONE deploy each instead, and 04-workers-restore is gone
// with it. policy-worker binds to nothing, and every worker that holds a
// binding waits on it (an enforced `dependsOn` on main). Its pre-deploy step
// runs this tool, which uploads a placeholder script for every binding target
// in this environment that does not exist yet. Every real deploy then starts
// after the placeholders exist, carries its full bindings, and replaces its
// own placeholder.
//
// Nothing else deploys while this runs (every binding holder waits on it),
// so a placeholder never overwrites a real Worker. On a live product every
// target exists and the tool uploads nothing.
//
//   node tooling/deploy/fleet-stubs.mjs --root ../..            # deploy step

//
// The targets come from every apps/*/wrangler{.template,}.jsonc: the
// `services[].service` names of the environment's section. The environment is
// --env, else ORUN_ENVIRONMENT (set by orun on every job). The account and
// token are CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, as the deploy step
// has them; CLOUDFLARE_API_BASE_URL overrides the API (tests).
